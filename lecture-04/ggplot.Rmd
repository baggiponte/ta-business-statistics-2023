```{r setup}
library(tidyverse)

theme_set(theme_minimal())
```

# Inspect the data

Let's see a pre-built dataset:

```{r load-mpg}
mpg
# if you want to inspect the data:
# ?mpg
```

# Bare plot syntax

Then we create a simple plot:

```{r simple-plot}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```

`mapping` is a special argument: combined with the `aes()` function, it *maps variables in the data to plotting elements*. We can also pass other arguments to `mapping`:

```{r more-aes-mappings}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, colour = class))
```

Some other arguments we can use:

- `size` (not recommended for quantitative variables).
- `alpha`, i.e. transparency.
* `shape`

![shapes](http://sape.inf.usi.ch/sites/default/files/ggplot2-shape-identity.png)

You can see the [docs](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/aes_linetype_size_shape.html) for a complete reference.

We can also pass these very same arguments **outside** of the `mapping` argument, to define behaviours that are independent of the data:

```{r more-aes-arguments}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy), colour="blue", alpha=0.8, shape=1)
```

We can use `{magrittr}`'s pipe operator (`%>%`) or the native-pipe (`|>`) to pass the data as an argument:

```{r using-pipes}
mpg %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))

mpg |>
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```

## The `mapping` argument

We can also specify the `mapping` argument inside the `ggplot` call:

```{r mapping-argument}
mpg %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point()
```

The aestethics specified in this way will be inherited by default in every subsequent `geom_*` (geometry). We can always override them in the `geom_*` function.

# Scales

`{ggplot}` also has elegant methods to change the scales of a plot:

```{r}
mpg %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=displ, y=hwy)) +
  geom_point(aes(color=class, shape=drv), size=2) +
  scale_colour_viridis_d() +
  scale_y_log10() +
  labs(
    title = "Engine displacement vs Highway consumption",
    subtitle = "Y is in log scale",
    y = "",
  ) +
  theme(
    plot.title.position = "plot",
    legend.position = "left"
  )
```

To interpret the `scale_*` layers, remember the following:

* The second component denotes the `geometry` or `mapping`. In this case:
  * `scale_colour` will affect the `color`.
  * `scale_y` will affect the scale of the `y` variable.
* The third argument denotes the type of transformation applied:
  * `viridis_d` denotes that the *viridis discrete* colormap is used.
  * `log10` applies a log10 transform to the axis.
    * Note that the axis' gridlines are scaled accordingly! Something like this would not have happened if we had transformed the `y` parameter directly. This is quite important, as it would have made interpreting the plot much more unintuitive.

# Coordinate planes

Here we use an example of a slightly more advanced data transformation. The `mutate` function (from the `{dplyr}` package) can apply a the same transformation to multiple columns. Instead of manually writing down every column, we can use the `across()` function. This function has a `.cols` argument and a `.fns` argument. To the first one, we pass the `where(is_character)` function: this will automatically filter out all the columns of our dataset that are of the type character. The second argument denotes the transformation we will apply to it, in this case a type conversion into factors.

With a simple `+ coord_*`, we can change the coordinates of our plots:

```{r}
mpg %>%
  # change the column type from char to factor
  mutate(across(.cols = where(is_character), .fns = as_factor)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=manufacturer)) +
  geom_bar(aes(fill=drv)) +
  scale_fill_viridis_d() +
  coord_polar()

mpg %>%
  # change the column type from char to factor
  mutate(across(.cols = where(is_character), .fns = as_factor)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=manufacturer)) +
  geom_bar(aes(fill=drv)) +
  scale_fill_viridis_d() +
  coord_flip()
```

While `coord_polar()` might be exotic or more niche, the `coord_flip` is an elegant solution to swap the axis of our plot. We could simply invert the `x` and `y` arguments of the `aes()` mapping, but this does not always work (e.g. with `geom_bar`, that only takes an `x` argument and computes the `y` "under the hood").

# Facets

the `facet_wrap()` "layer" can be used to split the plot in different *facets*.

> The first argument of `facet_wrap()` should be a formula, which you create with `~` followed by a variable name (here “formula” is the name of a data structure in R, not a synonym for “equation”). The variable that you pass to `facet_wrap()` should be discrete.

```{r facet-wrap}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  facet_wrap(~ class, nrow = 2)
```

You can also create a grid, to facet the plot on the combination of two variables:

```{r facet-grid}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  facet_grid(drv ~ cyl)
```

# Geoms

The `geom` attribute describes the *data representation*. Here we use a small extension package to display side by side two plot objects:

```{r geoms}
library(patchwork)

p1 <- ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  labs(title = "Scatterplot") +
  theme(plot.title.position = "plot")

p2 <- ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  labs(title = "Smooth Regression Line") +
  theme(plot.title.position = "plot")

p1 | p2
```

As said above, the `geom`s can take a `mapping` argument. However, not all arguments can be used in every `geom`: for example, the `shape` argument cannot be passed to a `geom_line()`.

Sometimes it's much better to combine mappings to make your visualisations much simpler to grasp:

```{r combine-mappings}
p2a <- ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, group = drv)) +
  labs(
    title = "Smooth Regression Line",
    subtitle = "By type of drive train (no color)"
  ) +
  theme(plot.title.position = "plot")

p2b <- ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_smooth(
    mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv),
    show.legend = FALSE
  ) +
  labs(
    title = "Smooth Regression Line",
    subtitle = "By type of drive train (with color)"
    ) +
  theme(plot.title.position = "plot")

p2a | p2b
```

We can also layer them:

```{r}
mpg %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth() +
  labs(
    title = "Smooth Regression Line + Scatterplot",
    ) +
  theme(plot.title.position = "plot")
```

In this case, setting a "global" mapping can help remove code duplication. We can still set custom aesthetics for each layer:

```{r}
mpg %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point(aes(color=class)) +
  geom_smooth() +
  labs(
    title = "Smooth Regression Line + Scatterplot",
    ) +
  theme(plot.title.position = "plot")
```

We can also change the **data** in each layer:

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(color = class)) +
  geom_smooth(data = mpg %>% filter(class == "subcompact"), se = FALSE) +
  labs(
    title = "Smooth regression line + scatterplot",
    subtitle = "Smooth line fitted only on `class == 'subcompact'`"
  ) +
  theme(plot.title.position = "plot")
```

# Extensions to `{ggplot}`

`{ggplot}` is so influential and versatile that many packages were written to extend its functionalities, or wrap them to build more advanced visualisations. You can see a list [here](https://exts.ggplot2.tidyverse.org/gallery/).

## Visualise Models

* The `{parameters}` and `{see}` packages are part of the `{easystats}` framework, to make statistical plotting and modelling easier.
* The `{ggsci}` package implements themes specific to some [publication journals](https://nanx.me/ggsci/articles/ggsci.html).

```{r}
library(parameters)
library(see)

mpg %>%
  # turn columns into factors
  mutate(across(where(is.character), as_factor)) %>%
  # fit a regression model
  lm(hwy ~ manufacturer + year + cyl + fl + class, data = .) %>%
  parameters() %>%
  plot() +
  ggplot2::labs(title = "A Dot-and-Whisker Plot") +
  ggsci::scale_color_npg()
```

They can also be quite sophisticated, such as `{ggstatsplot}`:

```{r}
ggstatsplot::ggbetweenstats(
  data  = iris,
  x     = Species,
  y     = Sepal.Length,
  title = "Distribution of sepal length across Iris species"
)
```

Note how intuitive it is to obtain such complex visualisations:

```{r}
iris %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Species, y = Sepal.Length)) +
  geom_violin() +
  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.2) +
  geom_jitter()
```
